# Birthday-Email-Sending-Program
This contains a list of contact and their birthdays. On their birthdays, it send a short and sarcastic email from a clearly automated account along with an inspirational quote

Names, emails, and birthdays are stored in birthdays.csv, and quotes in quotes.txt . As of now the only way to grow these lists is to manually open them. Using smtp, an email is sent from tatyana.automated@yahoo.com to the recipient when their birthday month and day coincides with the current month and date.

This project is day 32 of the 100 days to coding mastery challenge on Udemy.com . Feedback is always appreciated

Enjoy!
